# Bricks - The easiest way to build web and mobile applications

Bricks is a visual application development tool that makes it easy for anyone
to build database-driven web and mobile applications in minutes.

The applications generated with Bricks use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
for the interface and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) for the dynamic
components. They can be hosted on any web server or wrapped with
[PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) (or similar tools) for deployment on mobile
devices.
